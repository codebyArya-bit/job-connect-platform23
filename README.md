# Job Connect - Full-Stack Job Portal

A job listing platform that connects recruiters with job seekers. Built with a modern tech stack using **React.js** for the frontend, **Node.js** (Express) for the backend, and **MongoDB** for the database. This platform provides job listings, recruitment processes, authentication, and a complete dashboard for both job seekers and recruiters.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Axios, React Router
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT Authentication
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify, Heroku (for backend)
- **Styling**: CSS (Custom), Bootstrap (optional)

## Features
- **For Job Seekers**:
  - Register and Login via JWT authentication
  - Browse and apply for job listings
  - View application status
- **For Recruiters**:
  - Post new job listings
  - View job applications and candidate details
- **Admin**: (Optional Role)
  - Manage users, job listings, and applications
- **Real-Time Data**: Fetch jobs and applications in real-time using API calls

## Project Structure

### Frontend
- **`client/`**: React app containing the user interface and related components (e.g., job listings, job detail pages, login, etc.)
- **`public/`**: Contains `index.html` (the main entry point for React app)
- **`src/`**: React app components, pages, and services such as API integration (`axios`)

### Backend
- **`server/`**: Node.js and Express app that handles API endpoints, authentication, and database communication
- **`controllers/`**: Logic for handling API requests (auth, job listings, user management)
- **`models/`**: Mongoose models for MongoDB collections (Jobs, Users, Applications)
- **`routes/`**: API routes for authentication, job listings, and user actions
- **`middleware/`**: JWT authentication middleware
- **`config/`**: Database configuration (MongoDB connection)

### Deployment Configuration
- **Netlify/Vercel** for frontend deployment
- **Heroku** for backend (or Docker for local or production environment)

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** installed (Version 16+)
- **MongoDB Atlas** or local MongoDB server setup for database connection
- A **JWT_SECRET** for authentication (add it to the `.env` file)

### Steps to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/job-connect-platform.git
   cd job-connect-platform
````

2. **Install dependencies for frontend**:
   Navigate to the `client/` directory and run:

   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install dependencies for backend**:
   Navigate to the `server/` directory and run:

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**:
   Copy the `.env.example` files to `.env` in both `client/` and `server/` directories and configure the appropriate values.

   * **Client**: Set `REACT_APP_API_URL` to the backend API URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5000/api`).
   * **Server**: Set up your `MONGODB_URI` (use MongoDB Atlas or local DB) and `JWT_SECRET`.

5. **Run the development servers**:

   * For frontend:

     ```bash
     cd client
     npm start
     ```
   * For backend:

     ```bash
     cd server
     npm start
     ```

6. **Navigate to**:

   * **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
   * **Backend**: `http://localhost:5000`
